# Flappy Covid

> Flappy Covid is a Flappy Bird clone made in P5.js. The rules are simple. The objective is to direct a flying corona virus, who moves continuously to the right, between sets of pipes of soap. If the player touches the soap, they lose. If the screen is not tapped, the virus falls because of gravity; each pair of pipes that it navigates between earns the player a single point. On mobile you can tap and on desktop you click the left mouse button to jump.

### Code review 
by [Bernhard Stedt](https://github.com/Vehx) and [Marcus Augustsson](https://github.com/MarcusIsCode)

- When installing to test the game npm install worked.
- [sketch.js:2](https://github.com/henricbjork/GameOver/blob/44f974f0f05155c9668b0c3d4a1572a84710bb5c/sketch.js#L2) cnv variabel not necessary for creatcanvas in setup().
- [sketch.js:1-21](https://github.com/henricbjork/GameOver/blob/44f974f0f05155c9668b0c3d4a1572a84710bb5c/sketch.js#L1-L21) Long list with variabels some more comments describing what they are used for would be helpful.
- [sketch.js:108-187](https://github.com/henricbjork/GameOver/blob/44f974f0f05155c9668b0c3d4a1572a84710bb5c/sketch.js#L108-L187) Seperating functions into a seperate file to make it more readable.
- [sketch.js:171-187](https://github.com/henricbjork/GameOver/blob/44f974f0f05155c9668b0c3d4a1572a84710bb5c/sketch.js#L171-L187) The functions isResetButtonClick & isStartButtonClick have same code and can be reused.
- [pipe.js:38-41](https://github.com/henricbjork/GameOver/blob/44f974f0f05155c9668b0c3d4a1572a84710bb5c/pipe.js#L38-L41) Awesome way to make sure the image ratio stays correct.
- [index.html:10-16](https://github.com/henricbjork/GameOver/blob/44f974f0f05155c9668b0c3d4a1572a84710bb5c/index.html#L10-L16) Okay to use css in head when it's not much styling but generally preferred to use a seperate file.
- [bird.js:10-11](https://github.com/henricbjork/GameOver/blob/44f974f0f05155c9668b0c3d4a1572a84710bb5c/bird.js#L10-L11) If you use the constructor to set height and width the bird class can be more flexible for other options like a smaller size.
- [bird.js:13](https://github.com/henricbjork/GameOver/blob/44f974f0f05155c9668b0c3d4a1572a84710bb5c/bird.js#L13) Using a global variable makes it harder to follow the code, sending in the sprite in the constructor would make it easier.
- You have written efective code that needs few lines to work well, awesome job!
